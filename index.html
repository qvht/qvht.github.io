<h1>Qvht</h1>

<p>Chant: Be our vengeance, avenge us.</p>

<p>Neuroscientifically: Thoughts in motion create the mind (brain) and then by extention the body. Mental rehearsal leads to what we remember: Our ego, that is our sence of self is a shadow of what we spend our time on. Setting intentions and catalyzing them through meditation produces desired results aka magik.</p>

<h2>qvht.github.io</h2>
<p>
  In the neon-lit heart of the metropolis, where the ordinary meets the arcane, lies the clandestine nexus known only as Qvht. It stands as a digital domain and an urban labyrinth, a convergence point for the mysterious and the unknown. Here, shadows dance in the glow of noir lights, and the very fabric of reality seems to blur.
</p>
<p>
  Unfolding as a tapestry of speculum, a labyrinthine network of virtual alleyways and towering structures. Noir lights and holographic representations paint the pathways in a mosaic of cryptic alchemy, each step taken echoing in the creative expanse.
</p>
<h3>Chromatic-Steel Quantum Feild</h3>
<p>
  The structures within Qvlt are a matrix of chromatic-steel, towering like colossal pillars in cyberspace. The reflections of neon lights play upon their surfaces, creating a mesmerizing display of shifting colors. The air is charged with the hum of servers and the electric energy of digital endeavors.
</p>
<h3>Algorithmic Laboratories</h3>
<p>
  Nestled within the heart of Qvlt are the Algorithmic Laboratories, where lines of alchemy replace chromatic-steel and ceramic-porcelain. Here,  experiments within the imaginative become, merging the boundaries of word and consciousness. The sterile glow of screens illuminates a hidden realm of scriptural sorcery and virtual grimoire.
</p>
<h3>Twilight Alchemy Haven</h3>
<p>
  Venturing further into Qvht, the environment transforms into a Twilight Alchemy Haven. Verses of programming form gnarled trees, casting virtual silhouettes on the imagined ground. The glow of the holographic projections bathes the surroundings in an ethereal fusion of lore and twilight. Lines of corrupted alchemy ripple through the spectral swamp, and fragments of forgotten writings serve as eerie remnants of the rythmnical cycle.
</p>
<h3>Abyss of Infernal Lore</h3>
<p>
  At the nexus's depths lies an Infernal Data Abyss. Virtual flames lick obsidian pillars that mark the entrance to the deepest realms of the imagination. An intricate weave of digital souls writhes along the data streams, a visual representation of the nexus's tormented history. Graffiti messages in the alchemy echo the suffering that resonates through the ages of other.
</p>
<h3>Analog Microchip</h3>
<p>
  As users traverse this nexus of tides, choices materialize like bits in the binary. Whispers of data linger in the air, digital tendrils caress those who dare to explore, and Qvlt stands as a crossroads where destinies entwine and unravel in the vast expanse of cyberspace.
