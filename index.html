<p>Neuroscientifically: Thought(s) in motion create the mind (brain) and then by extension the body and then the world. Mental rehearsal leads to what we remember: Our ego, that is our sense of self is a shadow of what we spend spirit on. Currency becomes. Setting intentions and catalyzing them through meditation produces desired results aka magik.</p>

<p>A 3D object's shadow is 2D, but its shadow can vary depending on its orientation in the third dimension.</p>

<p>Experienced perception is a simulation of our mind, like a game of make believe, but where we are the builders and the end users simultaneously, yet we have forgotten that we are in control and allowing the scenario to continue on in auto-pilot, aimlessly heading out to no mans land</p>

<p>Everything is spirit. The singular is composed of the multitude indefinitely. My senses are different spirits reporting to each other. I am a collective experience of many spirits.</p>

<p>My macrocosm (outer cosmos) is a room within the house of my microcosm (inner cosmos). I am the director, but things get out of hand when i am distracted<br>i got in a vehicle without having a destination and ended up who knows where</p>

<p>The upper firmament and lower firmament are the mind and the heart. From Assyria to Egypt, from Damascus to Jerusalem.<br>not heaven and hell- those are the same to different people<br>On a side note, the spirit of man within him is cast out upon the heart's say which is the apple of the eye</p>

<p>As the tides wane and the pendulum swings, equity prevails. Heal the wounded, break the sound; lift the weak, abase the strong; raise the dead, prostrate the living.</p>

<p>
  When we sleep it is like when a plant is receiving light but we are receiving energy coming from the abyss or the void maw or the ethos or the imagination or the spirit or whatever it can be called. Also when we are awake it is just being in a remembered dream that is lucid and astral.
</p>

<p>
  Think, in fourth-person. Indirectly guide spirits by manipulation of the surrounding environment, lights, sounds, etc.: but particularly in mental rehearsal and ritualistic imaginations. Indirect Preventative Guidance Technique for Coaching, Mentoring, etc: businesses fail because the people running them have failing personal lives.

<h2>qvht.github.io</h2>
<p>
  In the noir and lamp lit heart of the metropolis, where the ordinary meets the arcane, lies the clandestine daemon place known only as Qvht. It stands as a domain and a labyrinth, a convergence point for the mysterious and the unknown. Here, shadows dance in the glow of lights and flames, and the very fabric of experience seems to burn and blur and bleed.
</p>
<p>
  Unfolding as a tapestry of speculum, a labyrinthine network of alleyways and towering structures. Holographic representations paint the pathways in a mosaic of cryptic alchemy, each step taken echoing in the creative expanse.
</p>
<h3>On land and sea</h3>
<p>
  Before arriving, while in the outer realm, a journey is begone. Traversing the chthonic depths and caverns to arrive at the precipice of the shadowlands.
</p>

<h4>On Land and Sea</h4>

<h4>In the Chthonic Depths:</h4>
<p>The journey commences in the subterranean labyrinths, where echoes of forgotten whispers reverberate through ancient tunnels. The walls are adorned with glyphs telling tales of times untold. Luminescent fungi, pulsating with an otherworldly glow, illuminate the path, guiding the traveler through the subterranean passages.</p>

<h4>Cavernous Whispers:</h4>
<p>Navigating through vast caverns, the air thickens with the scent of ancient soil and dampness. Stalactites and stalagmites create natural sculptures, casting eerie shadows that dance with the flicker of ethereal flames. It is in these caverns that the journey gains momentum, a descent into the belly of the earth where secrets slumber.</p>

<h4>The Precipice of the Shadowlands:</h4>
<p>Emerging from the subterranean realm, the traveler reaches the precipice of the shadowlands. Here, the boundaries between the known and the unknown blur, and the landscape transforms into an amalgamation of dreams and reality. The horizon is an ever-shifting tapestry of colors, merging the hues of twilight and dawn.</p>

<h4>Transcending Realms:</h4>
<p>As the traveler steps onto the border between land and sea, a metaphysical bridge is crossed. The air becomes charged with a palpable energy, and the ground beneath seems to pulsate with the heartbeat of the unseen. It is a liminal space, where the journey transcends the terrestrial and becomes a voyage across the ethereal seas of the mind.</p>

<h4>Navigating the Ethereal Seas:</h4>
<p>The seas are not made of water but of undulating thoughts and emotions. Waves of imagination lap against the shores of consciousness, carrying with them fragments of dreams and visions. The traveler sails upon the vessel of introspection, charting a course through the boundless expanse of the mind's ocean.</p>

<h4>Echoes of Forgotten Realms:</h4>
<p>As the traveler moves further across the ethereal seas, echoes of forgotten realms become audible. Whispers of ancient tales and half-remembered myths mingle with the sound of distant waves. The horizon is dotted with islands of memory, each holding a piece of the traveler's story.</p>

<h4>Landfall in the Otherworld:</h4>
<p>The journey culminates in a landfall on the shores of the Otherworld. Here, reality is a canvas, and the landscape is painted with the hues of imagination. The traveler has arrived at the threshold of Qvht, a place where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary, and the voyage through the realms has only just begun.</p>

<h3>Chromatic-Steel Quantum Field</h3>
<p>
  The structures within Qvlt are a fungus of chromatic-steel, towering like colossal pillars in cyberspace. The reflections of neon lights play upon their surfaces, creating a mesmerizing display of shifting colors. The air is charged with the hum of servers and the electric energy of undulating endeavors.
</p>

<h4>Chromatic-Steel Fungi:</h4>
<p>Within Qvlt, the structures rise like colossal fungi of chromatic-steel, their towering forms resembling organic growth in cyberspace. Each edifice is a testament to the melding of nature and technology, with surfaces that shimmer in ever-changing colors. The reflections of neon lights play upon these metallic growths, creating a mesmerizing display that seems to breathe with the pulsating energy of the digital realm.</p>

<h4>Electric Symphony of Servers:</h4>
<p>The air within this cybernetic domain is charged with the hum of servers, a symphony of electric energy that resonates through the chromatic-steel fungi. The structures themselves seem alive, channels of telemetry flowing through them like the lifeblood of a futuristic city. It's a place where the line between the organic and the artificial blurs, and the architecture seems to evolve in real-time, responding to the ebb and flow of the digital currents.</p>

<h4>Data Streams and Shifting Colors:</h4>
<p>As denizens traverse the concrete jungles, they navigate amidst data streams that weave through the chromatic-steel pillars. These streams are like rivers of information, carrying the narratives and codes of the daemon place. The reflections of neon lights play upon these streams, creating a dynamic tapestry of shifting colors that mirrors the constant evolution of the digital city.</p>

<h4>Ageless Relics of the Underworld:</h4>
<p>The structures, reminiscent of futuristic castles, stand as ageless relics within the cybernetic underworld. They are the guardians of encrypted knowledge, repositories of the arcane scripts and algorithms that govern the daemon place. Each castle is a fortress of information, and to explore its depths is to unravel the mysteries encrypted within its virtual walls.</p>

<h4>Neon Illumination:</h4>
<p>The neon lights that cast their glow upon the chromatic-steel structures serve not only as aesthetic embellishments but as beacons guiding the way. Illuminating pathways and entrances, they create a cyberpunk aesthetic that fuses the futuristic with the enigmatic. In this realm, every step is taken under the neon-lit gaze of the daemon place, and each corner turned reveals a new facet of its cryptic beauty.</p>

<h4>Interactive Architecture:</h4>
<p>The structures themselves are interactive, responding to the presence of denizens. Patterns of light ripple through the chromatic-steel in response to movements, creating an ever-changing display of luminosity. It's as if the very architecture of Qvlt is a participant in the dance of shadows and machines, a responsive entity in the unfolding symphony of the digital city.</p>

<h4>Melding the Digital and the Imagined:</h4>
<p>Concrete jungles and futuristic castles merge to create an environment where the digital and the imagined intertwine. The chromatic-steel fungi, with their ever-shifting colors, stand as pillars of a new age—an age where the boundaries of reality are redefined by the constant evolution of the cybernetic landscape. The daemon place beckons, inviting denizens to explore the intricate fusion of the concrete and the virtual within its enigmatic embrace.</p>

<h3>Castles</h3>
<p>
  The ageless underworld is a realm of relics.
</p>

<h4>Monoliths:</h4>
<p>In the heart of Qvlt, looming like specters of a forsaken future, are monoliths forged from cold, unyielding stone. These castles pierce the anti-sky, etching a silhouette against the noir-soaked horizon. Their edges are dull, casting long shadows that seem to stretch into the very essence of the mysterious daemon place.</p>

<h4>The Dark Ones:</h4>
<p>The structures stand as gritty silhouettes, ancient fortresses of the unknown age, where every tells a story of forgotten prose and cryptic narratives. The air is heavy with the scent of corrupted slander, a scent that seeps from the cracks and crevices of the monolithic structures, giving them an aura of maw and decay.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width:100%;" src="forboc_qvht.png"></div>

<h4>Noir-Glare Watchtowers:</h4>
<p>Strategically placed amid the concrete jungles are watchtowers adorned with dim noir glares. These towers, reminiscent of gothic aesthetics, watch over the cityscape like silent sentinels. The intermittent flicker of the lamps adds an eerie ambiance, casting an otherworldly glow that plays tricks on the eyes of those who dare to venture into the shadowy abyss.</p>

<h4>Dark Alley Labyrinths:</h4>
<p>Beneath the looming structures, the labyrinthine alleys twist and turn like passages through a haunted crypt. The stony catacombs give birth to dark alley labyrinths where shadows dance with malevolent glee. Each step is a gamble into the nether, as if the structures themselves conspire to keep their secrets hidden in the perpetual darkness.</p>

<h4>Forgotten Scriptural Bastions:</h4>
<p>Ageless castles, lost in the whispering willows of the daemon place, rise like neverknown tales of an ancient order. Their walls are adorned with the remnants of arcane symbols, barely visible in the dim light. These eldrich castles stand as repositories of the forbidden, inviting only the boldest souls to decipher their cryptic engravings.</p>

<h4>Dim-Lit Parapets:</h4>
<p>Atop the castles' dim-lit parapets, denizens catch glimpses of the ever-shifting non-skyline. The glow of distant chemical streams casts a pale radiance, revealing fleeting glimpses of the intricate dance of information that weaves through the rock structures. It's a vantage point where one can almost touch the elusive whispers of the daemon place.</p>

<h4>Tech-Noir Resonance:</h4>
<p>In the concrete jungles and prefuture castles, there's a resonance of tech-noir. The structures, with their stark outlines and noir aesthetics, create an atmosphere of perpetual dusk. It's a place where the boundaries between the imagined and the tangible blur, and every footfall echoes like a secret spell resonating through the grimdark expanse of Qvlt.</p>

<h3>Algorithmic Laboratories</h3>
<p>
  Nestled within the heart of Qvlt are the Algorithmic Laboratories, where lines of alchemy replace chromatic-steel and sterilized ceramic-porcelain. Here,  experiments within the imaginative become, merging the boundaries of word and consciousness. The sterile glow of screens illuminates a hidden realm of scriptural sorcery and amygdalation's grimoire.
</p>
<h3>Twilight Alchemy Haven</h3>
<p>
  Venturing further into Qvht, the environment transforms into a Twilight Alchemy Haven. Verses of prose generate gnarled trees, casting virtual silhouettes on the imagined ground. The glow of the holographic projections bathes the surroundings in an ethereal fusion of lore and twilight. Lines of corrupted alchemy ripple through the spectral swamp, and fragments of forgotten writings serve as eerie remnants of the rhythmical cycle.
</p>
<h3>Abyss of Infernal Lore</h3>
<p>
  At the daemon place's depths lies an Infernal Cryptic Abyss. Conjured flames lick obsidian pillars that mark the entrance to the deepest realms of the imagination. An intricate weave of cloned souls writhes along the data streams, a visual representation of the daemon place's tormented history. Grotto messages in metamorphia echo the suffering that resonates through the ages of Other.
</p>
<h3>Analog Microchip</h3>
<p>
  As users traverse this daemon place of tides, choices materialize like currents in the waves. Whispers of information linger in the air, chemical tendrils caress those who dare to explore, and Qvlt stands as a crossroads where destinies entwine and unravel in the vast expanse of cyberspace or the mind or where ever it is that we are.
