<p>Neuroscientifically: Thought(s) in motion create the mind (brain) and then by extension the body and then the world. Mental rehearsal leads to what we remember: Our ego, that is our sense of self is a shadow of what we spend spirit on. Currency becomes. Setting intentions and catalyzing them through meditation produces desired results aka magik.</p>

<p>A 3D object's shadow is 2D, but its shadow can vary depending on its orientation in the third dimension.</p>

<p>Experienced perception is a simulation of our mind, like a game of make believe, but where we are the builders and the end users simultaneously, yet we have forgotten that we are in control and allowing the scenario to continue on in auto-pilot, aimlessly heading out to no mans land</p>

<p>Everything is spirit. The singular is composed of the multitude indefinitely. My senses are different spirits reporting to each other. I am a collective experience of many spirits.</p>

<p>My macrocosm (outer cosmos) is a room within the house of my microcosm (inner cosmos). I am the director, but things get out of hand when i am distracted<br>i got in a vehicle without having a destination and ended up who knows where</p>

<p>The upper firmament and lower firmament are the mind and the heart. From Assyria to Egypt, from Damascus to Jerusalem.<br>not heaven and hell- those are the same to different people<br>On a side note, the spirit of man within him is cast out upon the heart's say which is the apple of the eye</p>

<p>As the tides wane and the pendulum swings, equity prevails. Heal the wounded, break the sound; lift the weak, abase the strong; raise the dead, prostrate the living.</p>

<p>
  When we sleep it is like when a plant is receiving light but we are receiving energy coming from the abyss or the void maw or the ethos or the imagination or the spirit or whatever it can be called. Also when we are awake it is just being in a remembered dream that is lucid and astral.
</p>

<p>
  Think, in fourth-person. Indirectly guide spirits by manipulation of the surrounding environment, lights, sounds, etc.: but particularly in mental rehearsal and ritualistic imaginations. Indirect Preventative Guidance Technique for Coaching, Mentoring, etc: businesses fail because the people running them have failing personal lives.

<h2><a href="https://qvht.github.io/">Qvht.github.io</a></h2>
<p>
  In the noir and lamp lit heart of the metropolis, where the ordinary meets the arcane, lies the clandestine daemon place known only as Qvht. It stands as a domain and a labyrinth, a convergence point for the mysterious and the unknown. Here, shadows dance in the glow of lights and flames, and the very fabric of experience seems to burn and blur and bleed.
</p>
<p>
  Unfolding as a tapestry of speculum, a labyrinthine network of alleyways and towering structures. Holographic representations paint the pathways in a mosaic of cryptic alchemy, each step taken echoing in the creative expanse.

<h3>Echoes of the Abyssal Maw</h3>

<h4>Part 1: "Descent into the Chthonica's Lair"</h4>

<p>
  #VoidMaw #CyberNoir #TriumphantDeath #ForbiddenLove #RitualSacrifice #MartyrsBlood #AbyssalEchoes
</p>

<p>
  As I ventured deeper into the labyrinthine depths of the Underworld, the weight of Chthonica's enduring legacy pressed upon me. The air whispered tales of forbidden romance, their passion echoing through the ages, haunting the very walls that bore the scars of relentless persecution. I stumbled upon a hidden chamber, its stone altar stained with ancient blood, a testament to the dark rituals performed within. 

  "This place... it's like a mausoleum, a tomb of secrets and suffering," I muttered, my voice echoing eerily in the confined space. 

  Suddenly, a chilling sound reverberated through the chamber, sending shivers down my spine. It was a chorus of voices, melding in a macabre symphony, recounting tales of faith and endurance, of martyrs who faced their persecutors with unwavering resolve.
